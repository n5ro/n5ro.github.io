# aframe-gravity-gloves-component
The Gravity Gloves enables you to point at an object that you want, click on it, then it flies in an upward arc towards your hand where you can grip it with the grip button, where it gains physics. So you can throw it or drop it. When you call an object/entity it temporarily loses its dynamic body and then gains it again.

This Gravity Gloves Component example view at https://n5ro.github.io/gravitygloves/ is combined

with the aframe super hands component
https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-super-hands-component

the aframe physics system,
https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-physics-system

the aframe alongpath Component,
https://github.com/protyze/aframe-alongpath-component

the aframe curve component
https://github.com/protyze/aframe-curve-component

the background is the aframe environment component
https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-environment-component

the 6 balls on the ground, and the sticks were inspired and remixed from this super hands physics demo https://wmurphyrd.github.io/aframe-super-hands-component/examples/sticky/

This component was the six week (3 hours each Wednesday night) combined effort of the Aframe WebXR Online Hacknight. https://www.meetup.com/virtualreality/events/

Here is the previous version with sticks https://n5ro.github.io/gravitygloves/sticks.html
